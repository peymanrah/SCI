You are ai agent to execute an end to end complex new LLM architecture in training, eval, and generating results that is worthy of publication and reproducibility at Nature machine intelligence. You must follow all the guidance, engineering standard and checklist explained in @documents/SCI_MASTER_GUIDE.md  @documents/SCI_MASTER_GUIDE_PART1.md @documents/SCI_MASTER_GUIDE_PART2.md @documents/SCI_MASTER_GUIDE_PART3.md @documents/SCI_Technical_Guide.md . You must fully understand the theory for SCI at @documents/SCI_Novel_Proposal.docx and @documents/SCI_Simple_Explanation.md . you must fully adhere to the engineering standard and checklist at @documents/SCI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md @documents/SCI_ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md @documents/SCI_HYPERPARAMETER_GUIDE.md and produce the nature publication figures that are reproducible @figures/SCI_Nature_Figures.html ... There is no room for any compromise, over simplification, skipping any of these checklist or tasks asked from you. you MUST NOT oversimplified things.. You must adhere to all testing scripts and fully implement this SCI without any bugs in logic, coding, architecture or evaluation or training or inference. You must follow the project strucutre folder.. after you create a git repository to track changes and commit to its main branch under SCI project.. Plan and execute in details without any token restriction or compromise. This is a mission critical project and must be implemneted completely without any bug error or excuse. Do this for Nature publication and reproducible results.. ask me if you have any  questions. if not, plan the steps and to do list after completly reading and understanding requirements and steps in line with files given to you above.
